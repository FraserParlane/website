                I cofounded and led a program of >30 engineers and scientists that deployed <a href="https://youtu.be/hFBMSkihjHE">autonomous robotic laboratories</a>. My team used <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-021-01156-3" target="_blank">flexible automation</a> to build self-driving labs that automate materials discovery. As lead data scientist, I implemented <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28580-6" target="_blank">multi-objective</a> <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aaz8867" target="_blank">Bayesian optimization</a> algorithms, performed multithreaded simulations, developed pipelines and dashboards, designed automated experiments, and created custom spectrometers. The project resulted in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iNFigAoAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">8 publications</a>, >200 citations, and >$1.5M in follow-on funding.<span class="year-slug"> | 2020-2022</span>

                As a Technical Program Manager and Software Engineer intern, I created a dashboard that ingested calorimetry data from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1256-6">fusion reactors</a>. The dashboard enabled 30 collaborators to make on-the-fly experimental decisions. I <a href="https://github.com/calorimetry/CSID" target="_blank">open-sourced</a> the system identification software used to model the reactors.<span class="year-slug"> | 2017</span>
